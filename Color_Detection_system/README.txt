Created a simple color detection system using photoresistors.

A simple object color detection system using Arduino RGB LED's and photoresistors

INSTRUCTIONS AND TUTORIAL WILL SOON BE AVAILABLE AT INSTRUCTABLES

  CONTENTS OF THE CODE:-
   The .ino file contains a ready to go color detection and printing mechanism built to identify colors based on their reflectance values 
   that are read by the photoresistors.
   
  Principle: RGB Led's are pulsated on test surface individually and their reflectance values are measured through photoresistor ,based
  on reflectance values the test color can be identified.
   
TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:-
  To test the arduino board, go to file-examples and upload and run the blink.ino sketch to see if its working.
